Rubyhash~

This plugin is for the conversion of key "styles" in Ruby hash literals.
The three styles supported are symbols, strings or Ruby 1.9.

Usage~

Rubyhash will convert all hash keys on the current line to the selected
style via the following default keymappings:

<Leader>rs Convert all hash keys to symbols
<Leader>rt Convert all hash keys to strings
<Leader>rr Convert all hash keys to Ruby1.9 format

Overriding the default keymappings~

Adding the following variable to your .vimrc will disable the default 
key mappings:

let g:rubyhash_map_keys = 0

You can then define your own keymappings to the following functions:

ToSymbolKeysLinewise()
ToStringKeysLinewise()
To19KeysLinewise()

Caveats~

The regular expression that identifies a potential key is fairly naive - only considers the following pattern: [a-zA-Z0-9_].
